## Summary
This program is designed to represent the structure of someone's Google Drive. It does this by acting as a command line interface tool that can generate a report about someone's existing drive if given information about it. First, the user must follow the onscreen instructions to generate their simulated drive. This includes providing login information, and manually adding every item they wish to have represented. They can add PDFs, word documents, powerpoint files, and spreadsheets. Each of these files has unique properites. After the correct data is added, the program will generate a report of the drive. This generates storage information, and a fully interactive menu that can be used to navitage through the drive. The user can manually select items to view, and all relevant information will be displayed.
